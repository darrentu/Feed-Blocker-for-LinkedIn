Introducing Feed Blocker for LinkedIn. With this extension, you can block both your LinkedIn feed and LinkedIn News. 

### Features

- Block your LinkedIn Feed
- Block LinkedIn's News


###  FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

#### When I click on the toggle, it doesn't block the feed! What's going on?

LinkedIn frequently releases new code. If it doesn't work, it's probably because LinkedIn just recently updated their code base. If I notice it, I will fix it and push an update to this extension. Feel free to comment within the reviews tab if no update has occurred.


### DISCLAIMER:

I do not store any of your data. The only data that is stored is kept on your own computer. This is needed for Chrome to remember what you selected to hide when you refresh your page.
